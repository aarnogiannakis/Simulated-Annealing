# Simulated-Annealing for CloudComp Scheduling

This script implements a Simulated Annealing algorithm with Reheating for solving the CloudComp Scheduling problem. The goal is to minimize the total makespan of the batch, optimizing the assignment and scheduling of operations across processors.


### Key aspects of this algorithm include:
- **Neighborhood Operator:** The algorithm utilizes swap operations between jobs to generate neighboring solutions, aiming to explore various job orderings within processors.
- **Termination Criteria:** The algorithm is designed to run within a predefined time limit, ensuring that the solution process completes within an acceptable timeframe.
- **Step Criterion**: The selection of the next move is based on a probabilistic approach. If a move improves the current solution, it is always accepted. Otherwise, it may still be accepted based on a probability that decreases with temperature.
- **Cost Function:** The algorithm operates on a duration matrix and a processor assignment matrix, both derived from the input file. The cost of a solution is determined by the makespan, which is the maximum completion time across all processors.
- **Initialization:** The initial solution is generated by assigning operations based on randomly generated permutations of job orders, providing a diverse starting point for the optimization.
- **Simulated Annealing:** The algorithm dynamically adjusts the temperature according to a cooling rate (Î±), balancing the exploration of new solutions and the exploitation of known good solutions over the course of iterations.
- **Reheating:** If no improvement is observed after a predefined number of iterations, the algorithm reheats by resetting the temperature to its initial value, allowing for renewed exploration of the solution space.

This script encapsulates the implementation of an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) for addressing the production planning problem at PlastOut A/S. The primary objective is to maximize the revenue by effectively planning the assignment of orders to production lines within a specified time horizon, accounting for individual product revenues and additional revenue from pairing products on the same production line.

### The ALNS employs the following strategies and components:
-   **Initialization**: Generates a feasible initial solution that respects production line capacities and maximizes initial revenue using a deterministic heuristic.
-   **Destroy Operators**: Two methods are implemented to remove orders from the production lines, promoting solution space exploration:

                     1. Apocalypse - Randomly removes a subset of orders. 2. Ragnarok - Targets specific orders and their neighbors for removal.

-   **Repair Operator**: A greedy heuristic, Bob_The_Builder, that reinserts orders to optimize the current solution, aiming for revenue increment.
-   **Adaptive Mechanism:** Dynamically adjusts the probability of employing destroy operators based 
                       on their past performance, balancing diversification and intensification.
                       Reheating is applied for the simulated annealing after an extended period of iterations.
-   **Acceptance Criterion**: A combination of Improving Solution and a Simulated Annealing acceptance strategy is utilized to escape local optima by accepting non-improving moves with a certain probability.
-   **Termination Criteria**: The algorithm concludes when a predefined computational time has been reached, ensuring efficient execution.
-   **Objective Calculation**: Revenue calculation considers both individual order revenues and pairwise revenue boosts for co-located orders.
